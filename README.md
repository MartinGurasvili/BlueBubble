    This is a Decentralised Peer to Peer Chat Application. That makes sure only necessary data is Decentralised whilst the majority is local to the device. Loaded with a modern UI and features other P2P apps lack.

    Like with every software, it is never truely finished - you can always add new features, make more improvements - so hear is an explaination of the current state of the project - and how I would propose the next step in development would be - if I did decide to develop this software further in the future or if you decide to try :)

    <h1 align="center">Current Architecture Model</h1>

    This model assumes that both devices have already added eachother to their contacts - using their Unique ID <br>
    <br>
    - When wanting to send or receive a message - you have to open the messaging tab with their contact. <br>
    - You computer searches for a premade connection or then a temporary server that is hosted by the contact<br>
    - If none of the above is found - your device becomes the host - and waits for a connection from the contacts IP and Port <br>
    - When both devices are connected to the temp server - Port Hole punching occurs and the temp server is terminated  <br>
    - Now as long as one of the devices keeps the application running they can both exchanges messages - Privately and Securely
     <br>

<h1 align="center">Current Downsides</h1>
    <div align="center">
    <p align="center">
    This Current Model Lacks a major feature of offline messaging - due to it being serverless.<br>
    Therefore if the contact is offline all the messages sent would not reach them, only to be saved locally on the senders device <br>
    Also, this solution is IP dependant if IP is changed - device will not be able to send and recieve messages until IP is set back to original <br>
    </p>

<h1 align="center">Proposed Architecture Model</h1>
    <div align="center">
    <img alt="2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76784461/193946852-766fa7b0-379e-425a-b310-c50b2f28fe86.png">

    This model is based of a torrent - distributed file model  <br>
    This model assumes that all contacts have a unique encryption key between them. <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Getting Offline Messages</h3>
    - When opening the application - your device downloads the latest Database from the other users that are online <br>
    - You check if any entrys in the DB are older than 5 Days - if so delete them <br>
    - All your messages in the DB are encrypted with different encryption keys based on contact  <br>
    - You decrypt your messages, save them locally to each contacts chat and delete them from the DB  <br>
    <h3>Sending Offline Messages</h3>
    - Only if your contact is offline<br>
    - You Upload your encrypted message to the DB - where others connected users will download it <br>
    - To prevent DDOS and bloating of the DB - upload requests are limited <br>
     <br>
